Developed a machine learning project utilizing the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits. 
Preprocessed the dataset by normalizing the pixel values and reshaping the images for model input. 
Trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the digits with high accuracy. 
Evaluated the model on the test set and achieved a significant recognition accuracy.
